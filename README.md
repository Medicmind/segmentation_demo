# IOS Demo for UNet segemention classifier generated by Medicmind

Demonstrates how to incorporate a trained segmentation model from Medicminds AI platform (https://www.medicmind.tech) into an iPhone App.
The neural network trained detects the optic disc in a retina using your camera. In the future will add the ability to use images from your gallery.

To incorporate your own model simply replace the 'checkpoint_weights.mlmodel' with your own one from Medicmind.
